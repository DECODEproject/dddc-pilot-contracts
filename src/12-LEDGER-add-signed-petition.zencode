Scenario 'coconut': "Add a petition to the ledger (count): here the petition signature created by the citizen is aggregated with the petition and written to the ledger, no encryption is used"
Given that I have a valid 'petition_signature'
and I have a valid 'petition'
and I have a valid 'verifiers'
When the petition signature is not a duplicate
and the petition signature is just one more
and I add the signature to the petition
Then print the 'petition'
and print the 'verifiers'
