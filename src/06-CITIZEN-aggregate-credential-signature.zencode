Scenario 'coconut': "To run by citizen and store the output as credential.json"
Given that I am known as 'identifier'
and I have my valid 'credential_keypair'
and I have inside 'issuer_identifier' a valid 'credential_signature'
When I aggregate the credential in 'credentials'
Then print my 'credential_keypair'
and print my 'credentials'
