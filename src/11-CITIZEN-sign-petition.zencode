Scenario 'coconut': "Sign petition: the Citizen signs the petition, with his own keys, aggregating it with the credential and with the Credential Issuer public key"
Given that I am known as 'identifier'
and I have my valid 'credential_keypair'
and I have my valid 'credentials'
and I have inside 'issuer_identifier' a valid 'ca_verify'
When I aggregate verifiers from 'ca_verify'
and I sign the petition 'petition'
Then print the 'petition_signature'
