Scenario 'coconut': "To run by citizen and send the result blindproof_credential.json to the verifier/checker"
Given that I am known as 'identifier'
and I have my valid 'credential_keypair'
and I have my valid 'credentials'
and I have inside 'MadHatter' a valid 'ca_verify'
When I aggregate verifiers from 'ca_verify'
and I generate a credential proof
Then print the 'credential_proof'
