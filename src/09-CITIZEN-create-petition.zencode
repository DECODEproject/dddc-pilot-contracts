Scenario 'coconut': "Citizen creates a new petition, using his own key, the credential and the credential issuer's public"
Given that I am known as 'identifier'
and I have my valid 'credential_keypair'
and I have my valid 'credentials'
and I have inside 'issuer_identifier' a valid 'ca_verify'
When I aggregate verifiers from 'ca_verify'
and I generate a credential proof
and I generate a petition 'petition'
Then print the 'credential_proof'
and print the 'petition'
